1. Same problem that occured for C. No arrow to duplicateNumber. do-while loop is wrong, pos_next and neg_next
   should be with the while statement, not the do statement. There is no loop_update in while loop.
   test() and static void test() should not be two different nodes. There is a node "182", which is nonsensical.

2. Same problem that occured for C. Can't detect call to average() from inside printf()

3. Shows destructor calls correctly, but does not show constructor calls. Shows nonsensical nodes.

4. There is a nonsensical node with a implicit_return edge after the constructor. This should not exist.

5. There shouldn't be an edge from if(node > 100) to std::cout << "if done\n";


6. Can't handle namespaces at all.

7. There is a nonsensical node after return from lambda. Also, 12_ shouldn't be split into two nodes.
   It should be one lambda definition.

8. Can't handle inner classes at all.

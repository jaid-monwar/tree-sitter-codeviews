1. Crashes if there is any variable/struct/class named "node"
2. Can't handle pure virtual functions. Creates an "ERROR" node instead of the assignment operator
3. The order of string_content and "hello world" is inverted. "hello world" should be the child of string_content. Also, treating cin and cout as binary expressions seems awkward

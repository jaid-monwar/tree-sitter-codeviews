Replace SCOPE with the :: symbol

1. do-while loop is wrong, pos_next and neg_next should be with the while statement, not the do statement.
   There is no loop_update in while loop.

2. There should not be a constructor call for va_list

3. implicit_return should not be a node. There are next_line edges where they shouldn't be. See 4.

4. There is a next_line edge every time a constructor is called that bypasses the constructor call. This shouldn't exist.
   Either handle the consturctor call like a normal function call, or remove the next_line edge.

5. There shouldn't be an implicit_return node.

6. implicit_return node should not exist. 

7. implicit_return node

1. Can't detect function call inside another function call.
2. Can't detect function call in index = duplicateNumber().
   "test" and "static void test" shouldn't be two different nodes.
   there is no recursion here, but the cfg shows recursion.
   do_while loop is wrong. the arrow from while to do should be pos_next. the arrow from do to tortoise should be next_line.


Can't detect function calls unless it's standalone.

1.  double edge in cpp. also, there shouldn't be an edge between 1 and 3 in c or cpp.
    there should be an edge from 6 to 7, since parameter declaration is a variable declaration.
    there are edges from fn to both printf statements, instead of just one.

2.  double edge

3.  Can't handle namespace. Here Room1::p is being changed and then printed.

4.  there shouldn't be an edge from 23 to 13 since it's pass by value, not reference.
    shouldn't be an edge from 23 to 14 either

5.  extreme confusion between 3 completely different classes/structs that have the same variable and function names.
    same problem exists in the cfg. it thinks the 3 functions are same, even though they are in different classes.

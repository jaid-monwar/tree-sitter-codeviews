There are 2 ways variables insides structs/classes can be handled in DFG when they are modified externally:

1. Each variable inside the struct is handled differently. For example, in error_1_struct.c, there can be an arrow from
   the definition of obj.a to every use of obj.a. Same goes for obj.b.

2. The entire object is treated as one variable. So, there will be an arrow from the definition of obj to every modification
   and use of obj, regardless if it's obj.a or obj.b

Currently, both C and C++ handle the same file differently, and none of them conform to one of the 2 standards, instead use a weird mix of both.
Ensure that both C and C++ use scheme 2, it makes more sense from an OOP perspective.

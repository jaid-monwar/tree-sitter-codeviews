CFG
This is a very nuanced thing. The generated CFG is correct if we don't know what kind of object is being referred to
by baseptr. Both NS1::DerivedClass and NS2::DerivedClass is possible.
But in this specific example, we know with 100% surity that baseptr contains an object of NS1::DerivedClass,
so there should not be an edge to the mutate function in NS2::DerivedClass
You have to check the type held by baseptr from the symbol table, if it is known then one edge, if it is unknown/ambiguous
then multiple edges to multiple derived classes.

DFG
The dfg is wrong because it shows a connection between x and NS2::DerivedClass, but it should be NS1::DerivedClass.
Also, it does not show the change of ns1_first inside the constructor of NS1::DerivedClass.
The same argument made in the CFG section also applies here. There should not be two arrows in this specific case.

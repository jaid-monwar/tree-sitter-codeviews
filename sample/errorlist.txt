CFG
1. Edge for the constructor call. First BaseClass constructor, then NS1::DerivedClass constructor
2. Edge for the call to mutate()
3. At the end of main(), call to destructor. First NS1::DerivedClass destructor, then BaseClass destructor

DFG
1. mutate() is pass by reference. There should be an edge from the variable x to mutate()
